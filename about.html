						<h2>About Me</h2>
						<p>
						Hi! I'm Prathamesh Gawde, I'm a mechanical engineer by profession.
						I live in Mumbai, Maharashtra. <br>
						Engineering and art is a rare combination, but a beautiful one nevertheless. Art, for me, is and has always been my happy place. It has always resided in my heart, but I never took it in a serious way until 2012, and since then, it has never looked back.<br>
						
						One of my friend suggested me to start making paid portraits for people. At first, it didn't work well, did not turn out to be the way I expected it to be, but then I made my Instagram art account, <strong> @prattz_artwork </strong> and surprisingly, it turned out to be great! People started recognizing my work, I was appreciated, I even started getting portrait commissions.<br>
						
						The journey of art, for me, has forever been adventurous but challenging at the same time. Being a self taught artist, not being under someone's guidance and figuring out the technicalities, little details, minor mistakes, all by myself, has been quite difficult, but thoroughly interesting.<br>
						
						With engineering by my side as my profession, I still don't let it overshadow my art. If not a professional artist, I still am an artist at heart and I'd always be. Art may not be something I earn my living with, but it will always be something that makes me live.
						</p>
